task 1 took roughly 2 hours
task 2 took 40 minutes
task 3 took 1 hours

online resources i used involved the class lectures

classmates i asked for help were Scott Hartley, Mark Hunter

i didnt ask questions to instructors but i did speak to kpm John Byrne (1 session)

task 1 was quite simple
task 2 was somewhat difficult
task 3 was challenging

i feel like i can make a basic web server, 
reducing complexity would be a challenge for me
